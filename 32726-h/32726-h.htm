<h1>DEATH&nbsp;&nbsp;OF&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;B. E. M.</h1>

<span class="caption">The B. E. M. purred contentedly
as the giant stroked his
eyeballs</span>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Blast them!" the writer
groaned in bitter accents.
"How I hate those B. E.
M's.!"</p>

<p>"Hang them!" the artist yelled.
"How I hate those B. E. M's.!"</p>

<p>"Darn them!" the B. E. M. moaned.
"How I hate those humans!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The artist and the writer sat
staring at each other in wordless
misery, their coffee untasted and
their spirits at low ebb. Up above,
in the beehive that was the publishing
house which gave them
their livelihood, the word had gone
around. <i>B. E. M'S, B. E. M'S....</i></p>

<p>Sadly, in accents forlorn, the
writer said:</p>

<p>"Bug-eyed monsters! Ye gads!
Bug-eyed monsters! Jack, old boy,
do you realize we're setting science-fiction
back a hundred years?"</p>

<p>"I know just how you feel, Harry,"
the artist replied. "After all,
we too had presumed that we had
been freed of these monsters. So
back we go to the drawing board,
our minds tortured and twisted ..."
He sighed disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," the writer sighed and
blew out his breath. He stared fixedly
at his coffee until a something
blue slipped into focus. His glance
traveled upward from the hem of
the girl's apron, past the lovely
swell of her charms and on past the
sweet throat, to the gay, smiling
face and sparkling eyes. Forgotten
then were B. E. M's. for both.
Diane, the goddess of the restaurant
corps of enchanting waitresses,
was at their side....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Hiah-Leugh was having his eyeballs
massaged. It was a delicate
and tedious operation for the one
doing the massaging; not every Goman
was possessed of eight eyeballs.
But Hiah-Leugh was not an ordinary
Goman. Not he! He was chief
of all the Gomans, which meant he
was head of all the bug-eyed monsters
on the whole of the planet of
XYZ268PDQ.</p>

<p>The four-headed slave, one of the
giants Hiah-Leugh's tribe had captured
on one of their forays into the
terrible forest of Evil Contractions,
scratched himself with one of his
six arms. He was quite bored with
this peaceful, though tedious pursuit
the tribe of Hiah-Leugh had
given to him as his duties. Especially
the massaging of eyeballs. Of
course it helped to have six arms.
Ooh! His four heads ranged themselves
in a single line.</p>

<p>The slave had committed a sin.</p>

<p>There were three cardinal sins on
the planet of XYZ268PDQ. Two of
them were unmentionable and the
third was forgetting to massage all
of the eight eyeballs of Hiah-Leugh
at one and the same time. If it were
not for the massage the giants of
the planet would all live in peace.
But it took a man with six arms to
do the job. In fact it was to the regret
of Hiah-Leugh that the giants
did not have eight arms.</p>

<p>Now one of the eyelids was closing.
In a second or two it would be
closed completely and once a single
of the eight eyes closed the others
automatically followed suit. There
was but a single thing to do in this
case. The giant did it.</p>

<p>He poked his finger into the
drooping lid.</p>

<p>Hiah-Leugh awoke with a suddenness
of shock and startled surprise.
He howled in pain then leaped from
the chair, scuttling about the room-of-massage
on his twelve pairs of
crablike legs at a great pace.</p>

<p>"Heavens to Betsy!" Hiah-Leugh
screamed. "You <i>are</i> the
clumsiest giant.... But what can a
B. E. M. expect? Oh, well! You're
excused. Go and see if there are any
children to frighten...."</p>

<p>There were four different expressions
on the four heads. One
showed pleasure, and another, surprise and a third, gloom and the
fourth was blank completely. This
head was the dumb one. It had but
one expression, blankness. The four
heads bent and the great body bowed
low, and slowly, with great effort
and with many bumpings into
various pieces of furniture, the
giant bowed himself out of the massage
parlor.</p>

<p>Hiah-Leugh was left alone.</p>

<p>But not for long. Suddenly a
whole section of the wall slid back
showing another room. This was the
famous Gloating Chamber of Hiah-Leugh.
Here were brought all the
victims the tribe captured. And here
it was that their chief was supposed
to spend his time in <i>Gloating</i> over
the tortures his torturers were supposed
to spend their time in devising.
But business had been very bad
lately. Not only was there not a single
victim in the Gloating Chamber,
there was not a single torturer
available. Hiah-Leugh suddenly remembered.
Something about a picnic....
Then why had the wall slid
back?</p>

<p>"<i>Hiah-Leugh! Hiah-Leugh!</i>" it
was the clarion call of his ninth concubine,
the lovely and charming
Sally Patica. But what in the name
of all that was unmentionable was
she doing in the Gloating Chamber?
Of course she too could be <i>Gloating</i>!</p>

<p>He moved slowly toward the
room, hoping against hope she was
not in a bad mood. The last time
she had called in that tone of voice
he had suffered greatly. She had
made him go without an eyeball
massage for a whole week....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>She was pacing back and forth
on the long, raised platform.
Hiah-Leugh skirted the Iron Maiden,
the Pallid Pulley, the Bronze
Beater, the Copper Conker, and
Giant Mas-Mixer, which was a fake.
Nothing was ever mixed in it except
the noxious weed Hiah-Leugh used
in his pipe. At the sound of his approach
Sally stopped her pacing
and fixed him with a baleful glance
out of eyes, four and five. Eyes, two
and three were busy seeing if her
coiffure was right and eyes one, six
and seven were having their lids
tweezed. After all, she had twelve
pairs of legs which were also used
for hands. A heck of a lot could be
done with so many appendages.</p>

<p>She started in even before he
quite reached her side:</p>

<p>"Where is everybody? Do I have
to sit by myself every day? <i>Must</i>
you have your eyeballs massaged
<i>everyday</i>? Where are the torturers?
Where is everybody...?"</p>

<p>"I think there's a picnic scheduled
for today, dear," Hiah-Leugh
said.</p>

<p>"Why wasn't I told about it?"
Sally demanded.</p>

<p>She had very probably <i>been</i> told
about it but knowing his ninth concubine
and the limits of her memory,
she had very surely forgotten.</p>

<p>"Hiah-Leugh!" she broke in on
him before he could frame a reply.
"I'm so terribly, terribly bored!
There hasn't been a good torture
since, since ... when <i>was</i> the last
time there was a torture party?"</p>

<p>"The time Gin-Pad was caught
stealing wokkerjabbies from his
youngest child," Hiah-Leugh said.
"We put him in the Pallid Pulley
and stretched four of his legs until
they were longer than the rest. And
to this day Gin-Pad walks like he's
looking for something between his
forelegs...."</p>

<p>Six of Sally's seven pairs of eyes
crossed suddenly, a sign she was in
thought. Hiah-Leugh had the wishful
hope that the seventh pair would
cross. When that happened Sally
would be ex-concubine. She would
also be ex-living but that didn't
bother him. We all have to die sometime,
he thought. But why does she
have to live so long? The thought
processes of Sally Patica wound
their weary way and came to their
proper end. Life was boresome. And
she had to think of something to
make it less so. She did.</p>

<p>"Y'know, Hiah," she said as she
uncrossed her eyes, "I have an
idea...."</p>

<p>The chief of all the Gomans rolled
all eight pairs of his eyes ceiling-ward.
Not another of her ideas. Oh
no! Not that! The last time she had
one of her ideas it was for a treasure
hunt, a treasure hunt for a five-headed
giant, despite Hiah-Leugh's
insistence there were no such beings.
But she wanted one dead or alive.
She got it, dead. What Sally didn't
know was that her mate gave orders
to have one killed and have a fifth
head sewn on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Love, however, was as strong on
planet XYZ268PDQ as it was on
any other planet, and as burdensome,
and though Hiah-Leugh felt
his heart sink, he also knew he
would give in to her wishes.</p>

<p>"... What do you think of this;
bring some humans up here and
we'll run a torture party for our
fiends?"</p>

<p>The male's jaw dropped, all three
feet of it. This was even worse than
he had imagined. <i>Bring some humans
up here</i>, she said. Had she any
idea of what that entailed? No.
<i>NOO!</i></p>

<p>He tried to reason with her:</p>

<p>"Darling. Wait. Don't be hasty.
Let me explain. In the first place
have you ever met a human?"</p>

<p>"What difference does that
make?" she pouted. "I've heard
about them."</p>

<p>"But sweetheart," he went on in
his pleading. "They're quite horrible.
They have but one head, and
a single pair of arms and legs. They
walk upright and they can only bear
<i>children</i>...."</p>

<p>This was new to her.</p>

<p>"... Children...?"</p>

<p>"Yes! And they're horrible
things, really. Must be raised on
pablum and formulas and things
like that. <i>Formulas.</i> Sounds mechanical.
No, Sally, my pet. I'll think
of something else. Something which
will not require so much work...."</p>

<p>It was the wrong thing to say.
He knew it the instant he said it.</p>

<p>"<i>Work!</i>" she yelped. "So that's
what's troubling you. Too much
work you say. And what is occupying
your time now? Have you even
so much as gone to the forest of Evil
Contractions to capture a giant in
the past six months? Not you!
You're satisfied with the way things
are. You wouldn't give a hang if I
died of boredom. And when I ask
for something like a torture party,
all you can say is, it's too much
work."</p>

<p>She started to cry. And after all
she had seven pairs of eyes to shed
tears from. It was the biggest crying
jag since the invasion from
space a millenium before when the
invaders used tear gas....</p>

<p>Hiah-Leugh threw up all the arms
he could spare and shouted:</p>

<p>"Okay. <i>OKAY!</i> I'll call a meeting
of the Council and we'll plan
something."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"The situation is this," Hiah-Leugh
said in opening the
meeting, "we must (get the) right to work
and bring some humans up here."</p>

<p>The assembled B. E. M's. stopped
looking bored at the words. They
had wondered why their chieftan
had called the meeting. Now they
knew. One after the other they repeated
the words as if they couldn't
believe their senses. Humans! Here
on Planet XYZ268PDQ.</p>

<p>"But mighty chief," one of them
said in objection. "Do you realize
what you're asking of us?"</p>

<p>Another said:</p>

<p>"How, when...?"</p>

<p>And a third asked:</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Our scientists, that's who,"
Hiah-Leugh answered. "What the
heck we got them for anyway?
Seems all they do is sleep. Let them
wake up and to work."</p>

<p>But the oldest and wisest of them
said:</p>

<p>"Why can't we be normal monsters
and not act like we're expected
to? Isn't peace enough for
us? Must we look for trouble?"</p>

<p>But their chieftan knew there was
no turning back. Not if he wanted
peace. And knowing Sally Patica,
he also knew there would be no
peace for him until he brought some
humans up for torture.</p>

<p>"Let them construct space ships,
terrible weapons of war, plagues
and all the necessary adjuncts to
planetary invasion. Let them prepare
for the holocaust," Hiah-Leugh
shouted, drowning out the
others.</p>

<p>But it was the youngest, a mere
youth of ten thousand years, upon
whose head but a single eye showed,
who pointed out the path. He was already
bored with this meeting; besides,
he had but fallen in love the
day before and wanted to get back
to his amorata.</p>

<p>"Why all this fuss?" he asked.
"What's more, we don't have scientists,
or mathematicians, or warriors.
If the giants weren't so stupid
we'd never capture them. So
let's stop this foolishness, this
dreaming...."</p>

<p>That was the clue. After all, Hiah-Leugh
hadn't been made chief of
all the Gomans for nothing. He
proved his right to the leadership
then.</p>

<p>"That's it!" he said. "The artists
and writers of the human world
have made monsters of us, even
though we can't do any of the things
they pretend we can. There is but
a single attribute we possess which
they have said we do. We can project
ourselves through space and
time. So let us to the Earth, and
pluck one or two of these humans,
and if I may offer a suggestion, let
us take a writer and artist from
among them and bring them back
with us...."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Harry Zmilch, writer-extraordinary
of science-fiction, passed
weary fingers across a furrowed
brow. A few feet to the rear of the
desk at which Zmilch labored stood
the drawing board of Jack Gangreneyellow,
the artist. He too paused
in his labors. At one and the
same instant they turned and regarded
each other with solemn, staring
eyes.</p>

<p>"No use, Joe," Harry said.
"I can't do it. I've beaten my
brain until it refuses to function. I
keep typing the same word over
and over again ... nuts ... nuts!...
Bug-eyed monsters! There aren't
such things. My imagination just
can't bring them to paper."</p>

<p>"Nor can mine to the board,"
Jack said.</p>

<p>"Still it's easier for you," Harry
said. "All you've got to do is draw
a spider or huge bug of sorts, put
a man and woman somewhere in the
drawing, make the woman appear
as if she'd lost half her clothes in a
struggle, and you've got your piece.
With me it's different."</p>

<p>Gangreneyellow snorted. This
character, he thought, knew as little
of art and the difficulties of composition
as the next guy.</p>

<p>"That's what you think," he retorted.
"All you guys have to do
is <i>imagine</i> a monster, have a man
and woman placed in peril by the
monster's presence and you've got
a story. With us it's different...."</p>

<p>Zmilch was half-turned, facing his
friend across the width of one shoulder.
At the other's words, Zmilch
turned all the way, got up from his
chair and strolled to the board on
which a drawing in full color was in
its last stages. The drawing depicted
a jungle scene. In the foreground
a man and woman stood in
petrified stance, the man's arm
around the woman's shoulders. He
was dressed for safari, pith helmet,
breeches, boots, open shirt and all.
The woman looked like she'd spent
all her life in the jungle. She wore
a leopard skin draped becomingly
to show the greater part of her
charms. They were in semiprofile
so that the artist could depict the
terror on their faces. And full in the
center of the drawing was an immense
web stretched between the
boles of two jungle giants. Descending
the web was a gigantic bug, or
spider, the artist had not detailed
it too well.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you were
finding it hard to do?" Zmilch
asked. "Why you've just about finished
it."</p>

<p>Gangreneyellow, not to be outdone
by his friend, walked over to
the other's desk and read aloud
from the author's manuscript:</p>

<p>"'... Tom Brighteyes knew he
hadn't the smallest chance of escaping.
The hordes of Micro Ambrosia
were but a short way off. Ahead
the Great Swamp blocked any
chances of escape for him and the
Leopard Girl. Their doom was sealed.
He turned to her and said:</p>

<p>"Leopard Girl, I love you. I
know. I'm from another world, a
world where men and women are
not the same as this. Oh, I don't
mean the outward man and woman,
but the inward. This is a savage
world, a world where both men and
women have to struggle to exist
against terrifying odds. Horrible
beasts, terrible insects, and natural
phenomena make this place a nightmare
of existence. But here I
found love and perhaps death. I am
not sorry I came."</p>

<p>"Tom Brighteyes," the girl turned
to him and drew close. "I love
you too. I think I felt love from
the first instant I saw you, backed
against a tree, with your puny
weapons facing Hogo the Mogo,
king of all the swampland. Hogo the
Mogo used to eat guys like you for
breakfast. Yet you drew a cigarette
from a silver, enamel case upon
whose shining face a small chaste
crest revealed your excellent taste
in such things, and while Hogo the
Mogo slavered his hate in your face,
you drew a king's size, Exhilirato
from the case and lit it with a nonchalance
that took my breath away...."</p>

<p>"What the heck are you complaining
about?" Gangreneyellow
asked. "You're not doing so badly
yourself."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said a strange voice.
"Neither of you are doing badly.
Everything is just horrible, isn't it?
The B. E. M's. march across your
pages and drawing boards with
assembly-line facility. But have
either of you two had any feelings
for us?"</p>

<p>The two men turned startled and
terrified faces in the direction of the
mysterious voice. They could see
nothing. Yet they could feel the impalpable
presence of some strange
being in this very room with them.
Suddenly they became aware of a
strange fog emanating from one
wall. It swept closer drawing them
into its greasy folds. The voice
seemed to come from the very heart
of this fog:</p>

<p>"... Well, perhaps things will be
different soon...?"</p>

<p>Then the fog enveloped them completely,
and their senses fled from
them....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was an odd sort of voice, mellow,
fluid, yet holding accents of
anger in its even flow:</p>

<p>"Both of you complained you
couldn't imagine this. So we brought
you here to prove its existence."</p>

<p>The writer and artist opened
their eyes and the fog in which
they'd been bound was no longer
there. They were in an immense
chamber whose vaulted ceiling extended
for a full hundred feet in
the air and seemed suspended by
slender strings, so tenuous were
the web-like supports, so fragile
were the arches. They were standing
before a tremendous table whose
semi-circular length might have
been fifty feet from one end to the
other. And seated at the table were
the most horrifying monsters they
had ever seen.</p>

<p>There was one, a huge beetle-like
thing with two heads and a scaly
body and four pairs of pincers extending
from the line of jaw.
There was, another, somewhat like
a spider, but with dozens of legs. A
third was half-man, half alligator;
a fourth was all snake, but with
three human heads; and another
was all head without body. They
were, the two men realized, the most
terrible <i>things</i> they had ever imagined.</p>

<p>"... And there is the rub," the
voice went on. "We are all as you
have imagined us. We exist only
in your imagination."</p>

<p>"But how can that be?" Harry
Zmilch asked. "We are here. We
can see you...."</p>

<p>"Only because your imaginations
have been developed to such a degree,"
the voice replied. "Were
you able to you would imagine us as
something altogether different.
But since there are limits to your
imagination we are as we are. Now
you must pay the penalty of that
imagination.</p>

<p>"Torture will be the price we will
exact from you...."</p>

<p>In an instant they were transported
to the torture chamber.
They saw the horrible machines,
the Copper Conker, the Pallid Pulley,
and the rest. And up on the
platform they saw Sally Patica in
all her glory, her seven pairs of
eyes watering so great was her excitement.</p>

<p>The monsters got in each other's
way so hurried were they to tie and
make fast the two humans to the
torture machines. And despite Harry's and Jack's screams, they were
bound, hand and foot and placed
on each of the machines in turn.
But though the machines whirled
and clanked and ground and grunted
and snarled their vicious ways the
two humans could not feel a single
thing. Yet all about them the
horrible monsters screamed and
shouted and laughed and danced
and on the platform Sally Patica
shrieked with joy.</p>

<p>"A torture party at last," she
screamed. "Oh, Hiah-Leugh, I'm
so happy. I'm the happiest monster
in the whole world."</p>

<p>But down below, on the last of the
machines in the assembly line, Harry
Zmilch thought as he was being
whirled around, his head always
meeting a mace-like thing which
was supposed to shear a slice from
his head at every turn but which
felt like a feather, gosh! If I get
back alive what a story I could do
on B. E. M's.</p>

<p>While on another instrument of
torture, the Pallid Pulley, a device
supposed to tear the limbs slowly
from a man, Jack Gangreneyellow
thought, man! what a cover I could
make if ever I get out of this.</p>

<p>A strange thing happened then.</p>

<p>The machines stopped their whirring,
the monsters stopped their
shriekings, and Jack and Harry
stopped moving.</p>

<p>"Ohh, you nasty humans," Hiah-Leugh
said. "Now you've spoiled
our party!"</p>

<p>"Why?" Harry asked.</p>

<p>"Because all this has been in vain.
All you can see is that we're monsters.
And as such we have no feelings
except for the giving of pain,
torture and death. Gosh, fellas!
Can't you see these things aren't
real? We're the nicest monsters."</p>

<p>But all Harry and Jack could
think of was that B. E. M's. were
real. Further, they were as terrible
as anything they had ever imagined.</p>

<p>"Yes," Hiah-Leugh went on.
"We are as you have imagined because
we live only in your imagination.
And there we live as monsters.
If in the beginning you had
given us other lines to read and
other lives to live, things might be
as they really are. But no. The
human race had to be the master
race. The insect world and the animal
world could only provide danger
and conflict." He turned to the
assembled monsters and said, sadly,
"Okay, boys. Turn 'em loose.
Let them go back to their typewriters
and drawing boards...."</p>

<p>Harry Zmilch shook his head
savagely and looked at his
friend. He was doing the same.</p>

<p>"Got dizzy for a second," Harry
said." Gees! Have I got a swell ending
for my story...."</p>

<p>"Funny," Jack said. "I got
dizzy too. And have I got a sweet
idea for a monster. All detail...."</p>

<p>Harry went back and typed:</p>

<p>'But Tom Brighteyes was no
longer listening to the voice of his
beloved. Behind him were the advance
guards of Hogo the Mogo.
And ahead the dreaded swamp.
There was but one thing to do, go
into the sixth dimension, the fifth
was already too perilous. Drawing
the girl within the embrace of
his brawny arms, he closed his eyes
and sent out the powerful thought
waves which would send him into
the sixth dimension....'</p>

<p>And at the end, he tacked on:</p>

<p>To be continued next month....</p>
